Projects from basics to advanced.

 printf function - <br>
   The printf function is used to output (print) text to the console. It's part of the standard input-output library (stdio.h).

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

 Decalaration function- <br>
 
 Declaration is when you declare a variable, specifying its type and name. It reserves memory space for the variable.
 ```
 int number;
float price;
char letter;
```
Here, number is an integer, price is a floating-point number(decimal), and letter is a character.
 
 Initialization funtion - <br>
 Initialization is assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of declaration.
```
 int number = 10;
float price = 36.5;
char letter = 'A';

```
